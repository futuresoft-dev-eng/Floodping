**FloodPing: IoT-Based Flood Monitoring and Alert System**

  1. PROPOSAL TITLE
**FloodPing: IoT-Based Flood Monitoring and Alert System**

   2. RATIONALE
Flooding creates a significant and growing threat in Barangay Bagbag, worsening due
to climate change, inadequate drainage infrastructure, and rapid urbanization. The barangay
frequently faces the challenge of consecutive typhoons, which lead to heavy rainfall and
overwhelming flooding. Traditional flood monitoring methods often fall short, failing to provide
real-time alerts and leaving residents and local authorities unprepared to take proactive
measures. This lack of real-time data complicates disaster response and increases the risk of
damage and loss of life.

An IoT-Based Flood Monitoring and Alert System specifically designed for Barangay
Bagbag addresses these urgent challenges. By providing a real-time, automated solution for
monitoring water levels and sending prompt message alerts, this system enables local
authorities and communities to respond more effectively to flood risks. In a barangay that
regularly experiences the impact of typhoons, having immediate access to accurate data is
crucial for effective decision-making during emergencies.
Leveraging modern IoT technology, the system can continuously gather and analyze
water level data, and send predefined message alerts directly to local authorities depending
on water level. This proactive approach not only helps save lives but also significantly
reduces property damage, making Barangay Bagbag more resilient against the recurrent
threat of flooding during typhoon season.

**General Objective.**
To develop FloodPing: IoT-Based Flood Monitoring and Alert System tailored for
Barangay Bagbag that provides real-time monitoring of water levels and automated alerts to
enhance flood preparedness and response during typhoons.

**Specific Objectives**
1. To develop a system that implements a role-based access control system that
categorizes users into predefined roles.
2. To develop a system that incorporates a water level threshold system that triggers
alerts for different flood levels based on predefined criteria relevant to Barangay
Bagbag.
3. To develop a system that has an IoT-based flood monitoring feature that continuously
tracks water levels.
4. To develop a system that enables the local authority admin to monitor the flood
conditions in real-time through their access level.
5. To develop a system that automatically sends alerts that inform local authorities when
water levels reach a specific threshold.
6. To develop a system that allows local authorities to send predefined flood message
alerts to residents.
7. To develop a system that tracks and logs flood data for the barangay.
8. To develop a system that has a supplemental power supply to maintain functionality
for the hardware.
9. To develop a system that will generate reports and allow for export as printable
documents.

**Scope**
1. The system will implement user-level access to enhance confidentiality and privacy,
ensuring various users only access relevant information to their roles and
permissions.
**FloodPing System Admin -** They can manage the accounts of Local
Authorities, which allows the admin to add, update, archive user accounts, and
set working shifts. They can also manage resident lists, such as adding,
updating, and archiving residents. Furthermore, they can monitor Local
Authorities' activity logs.
**Local Authorities -** Receive alerts about flood risks, manage flood messages,
and oversee the dissemination of flood alerts to residents. Monitor real-time
water levels, own activity logs, and access flood history logs to support
decision-making during flood events.
**Residents -** Receive timely SMS about flood risks in their area, ensuring they
are informed and can take appropriate actions. They can access basic
real-time data regarding flood conditions without requiring an access level to
the system.

2. The system will include four predefined flood risk alert levels, such as normal, low,
moderate, and critical that will trigger an alert only when the flood reaches the
specific water level threshold.

3. The system will install and integrate IoT sensors such as Waterproof Ultrasonic
Sensor in key flood-risk locations across Barangay Bagbag to monitor water levels in
real time.

4. The system will have a real-time flood streaming feature on the website using a
camera installed on the system to monitor flood height.

5. The system will send SMS alerts to local authorities as soon as flood thresholds are
reached.

6. The system will allow local authorities to use an SMS blasting tool to send predefined
flood message alerts to residents. The flood message alert contains the latest
updates on the flood level of stations.

7. The system will include flood history logs to record all the flood events in the area.

8. The system will include a solar panel as a primary power source for the system to
ensure continuous operations during power outages.

9. The system will have report generation and support file exporting in PDF format for
convenient printing of SMS logs.

**Limitation/Delimitation**
1. The system does not encompass predictive analytics capabilities, meaning it will not
forecast potential flooding events.

2. The system will not include machine learning algorithms for trend analysis, limiting its
capacity to adapt to changing flood patterns.

3. External power will be used as a backup power source, not as a primary power
supply. The system will temporarily stop operating once the two power sources are
unavailable.

4. The flood history logs will only record flood-related events in the specific stations,
excluding any other environmental-related data, such as rainfall, temperature, etc.

5. The system is limited to exporting documents to PDF format and does not include
printing operations.

6. The livestream data will automatically be deleted after one week.
